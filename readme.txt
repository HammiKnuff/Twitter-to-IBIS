[center][size=200]Twitter over IBIS[/size]

This is a smal program that displays recent Tweets from the Twitter search 
and sends it over serial with the IBIS protocol to (in my case) a 24 character "Next Stop"  display 
and generates scrolling text.
 
For use you may have to change the values/protocol/device to make it work with your setup.
