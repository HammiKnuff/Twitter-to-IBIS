Twitter over IBIS
using twitterscraper & pyIBISv2

This is a smal program that displays recent Tweets from the Twitter search
and sends it over serial with the IBIS protocol to (in my case) a 24 character "Next Stop"  display
and generates scrolling text.
 
For use you may have to change the values/protocol/device to make it work with your setup.
